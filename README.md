> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that gives lint reviews on PRs.

Currently works with typescript and tslint specifically.

## Plans
Add support to the following basic web technologies:
- [scss](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)
- javascript
- html
- [github markdown](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
- [json files](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint)

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```
